# pysarflow

An open-source python library for SAR data processing 

> [!WARNING]
> This library is under active development and lot of its functionality is still yet to code.


## Description

Despite the growing usage of SAR data, the processing workflow remains complex and still relies on specialized heavy desktop tools creating huge barriers for students and non-experts. There is a growing need for a modular, open-source and user-friendly workflow that can take Level-1 SAR products and guide users through essential steps ideally ending in products that are usable and compatible with geospatial pipelines.
